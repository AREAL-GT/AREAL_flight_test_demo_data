# AREAL Flight Test Demo Data

This repository holds flight test data and video for demonstrations performed
by the Aerial Robotics and Experimental Robotics Lab (AREAL) at Georgia Tech.

<!-- For flight test data and software related to 
a specific paper, please look through our labs public-facing GitHub 
organization [GT-AREAL](https://github.com/AREAL-GT). -->
