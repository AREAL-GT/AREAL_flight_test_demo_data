This directory contains data from basic indoor flight tests performed using 
the ROS 2-PX4 control framework. The data includes some video and PX4 data logs.

The included data does not currently line up (log does not match video), but
the UAV behavior is generally representative. We are working on getting a 
matching set of flights including video, PX4 logs, and time histories directly
from the motion capture system.
